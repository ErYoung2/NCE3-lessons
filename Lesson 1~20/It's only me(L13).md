After her husband had gone to work, Mrs. Richards sent her children to school and went upstairs to her bedroom. She was too excited to do any housework that morning, for in the evening she would be going to a fancy-dress party with her husband.

理查德夫人等丈夫上班走后，把孩子送去上学，然后上楼回到自己的房间。整个上午她兴奋到什么家务都不想做，因为晚上她要和丈夫一起去参加一个化妆舞会。

    

    

She intended to dress up as a ghost and as she had made her costume consisted only of a sheet, it was very effective. After putting it on, Mrs. Richards went downstairs. She wanted to find out whether it would be comfortable to wear.

她打算穿得像个鬼一样。尽管她已经将化妆服只由一个被单组成，但是却十分有效果。她穿上之后，下了楼，想知道这件衣服是否合身。

PS：dress up as...，穿得像个...一样

PS++：consist of...，由...组成

    

    

Just as Mr. Richards was entering the dining room, there was a knock on the front door. She knew that it must be the baker. She had told him to come straight in if ever she failed to open the door and to leave the bread on the kitchen table.

当她进入餐厅时，前门传来了敲门声。她知道一定是面包师来了。他曾对面包师说，如果敲门不应，就直接进来，把面包放在厨房的桌上。

    

    

Not wanting to frighten the poor man, Mrs. Richards quickly hid in the small storeroom under the stairs. She heard the front door open and heavy footsteps in the hall.

理查德夫人并不想吓坏可怜的面包师，于是她躲进了楼梯下的储物室。她听到前门开了，大厅里脚步声很重。

PS：Not wanting to frighten the poor man，原因不想吓坏这个可怜的人，这里做原因状语

    

    

Suddenly the door of the storeroom was opened and a man entered. Mrs. Richards realized that it must be the man from the Electricity Board who had come to read the meter.

突然储物室的门开了，一个男人走进来。理查德夫人意识到这一定是供电局的人来抄表了。

    

    

    

She tried to explain the situation, saying 'it's only me', but it was too late. The man let out a cry and jumped back several paces. When Mrs. Richards walked towards him, he fled, slamming the door behind him.

理查德夫人试图解释情况，她说“是我呀”，但是太迟了。电表工大叫一声，惊退了几步。当理查德夫人走向他时，他“砰”地一声关上门，然后跑了。

PS：let out a cry and jumped back several paces, 大叫一声，惊退了几步。此处let out可翻译为“发出”，且语气强烈；jump back可翻译为“惊退”，同样语气强烈。
