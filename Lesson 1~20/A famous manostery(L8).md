The Great St. Bernard Pass connects Switzerland to Italy. At 2473 meters, it is the highest mountain pass in Europe.

圣伯纳德大山口连接着瑞士和意大利，海拔2473米，是欧洲最高的山口。

PS: At ... meters, 此处理解为“海拔xxx米”。此处介词为at。

    

    





The famous monastery of St. Bernard, which was founded in the eleventh century, lies about a mile away.

著名的圣伯纳德修道院，建于11世纪，距离山口一里远。

PS: lie此处译为，坐落。

    

    





For hundreds of years, St. Bernard dogs have saved the lives of travelers crossing the dangerous pass. These friendly dogs, which were first brought from Asia were used as watchdogs even in Roman times.

几百年来，圣伯纳德修道院的狗狗们都在拯救过山口的旅者。这些从亚洲引进的善良的狗狗，在罗马时代就已经做为看门狗了。

PS：非限制性定从，修饰前面的dogs（dogs做从句的主语）

    

    





Now that a tunnel has been built through the mountains, the Pass is less dangerous, but each year, the dogs are still sent out into the snow whenever a traveler is in difficulty.

即使已经有了一条穿越群山的隧道，这个山谷仍然很危险。但是在游客遇到每到危险时，还是会派狗狗冲入雪中救人。每年都是这样子。

    

    





Despite the new tunnel, there are still a few people who rashly attempt to cross the Pass on foot.

尽管开通了新隧道，仍旧有很多人莽撞地徒步穿越山口。

    

    



During the summer months, the monastery is very busy, for it is visited by thousands of people who cross the Pass in cars. As there are so many people about, the dogs have to be kept in a special enclosure.

在夏天的几个月里，圣伯纳德修道院非常热闹，因为成千上万的人会开车穿越山口。因为很多人在附近，所以狗狗们需要被圈养在专门的围栏里。

    

    



PS：As there are so many people about， 此处about=around，当“附近”翻译。

In winter, however, life at the monastery is quite different. The temperature drops to -30° and very few people attempt to cross the Pass. The monks prefer winter to summer for they have more privacy.

而在冬天，修道院的生活就会很不一样。温度会低至零下30摄氏度，几乎没人尝试翻越山口。相较夏天，僧侣们更喜欢冬天，因为他们有更好的隐私。

PS：

prefer A to B          喜欢A超过B

prefer doing A to B          喜欢做A超过做B

    

    

  

The dogs have greater freedom, too, for they are allowed to wander outside their enclosure.

狗狗们也更自由，他们可以在围栏外闲逛。

The only regular visitors to the monastery in winter are parties of skiers who go there at Christmas and Easter. These young people, who love the peace of the mountains, always receive a warm welcome at St. Barnard's monastery.

冬天经常到访修道院的游客只有一批批滑雪者。他们在圣诞节或复活节跑去那边。这些喜爱平静山谷的年轻人，总是收到修道院的热烈欢迎。
