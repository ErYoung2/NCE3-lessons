The great ship, Titanic, sail for New York from Southampton on April 10th, 1912. She was carrying 1316 passengers and a crew of 891.

巨轮“泰坦尼克号”，在1912年4月10日从南安普顿出发，驶向纽约。这艘船上搭载了1316名乘客和891名船员。

    

    



Even by modern standards, the 46000 ton Titanic  was a colossal ship. At that time, however she was not only the largest ship that ever been built, but was regarded as unsinkable, for she had sixteen watertight compartments.

即使以现在的标准，46000顿的“泰坦尼克号”也是一艘巨舰了。但在那时，泰坦尼克号不仅是世界上建造最大的船，由于它有16个密封水舱的缘故，泰坦尼克号被誉为“永不沉没之船”。

PS: By modern standards, 以现在的标准。

    

    



Even if two of these were flooded, she would still be able to float. The tragic sinking of this great liner will always be remembered, for she went down on her first voyage with heave loss of life.

即使有两个舱进水，泰坦尼克仍然可以漂浮在水面上。由于它的首次航行就下沉，造成如此惨重的死亡，因此人们不会忘记这艘巨轮的惨剧。

PS：此处for因为原因状语从句。此从句为原因，主句为结果。

    

    



Four days after setting out, while the Titanic was sailing across the icy waters of the North Atlantic, a huge iceburg was suddenly spotted by a lookout.

启程第四天，当泰坦尼克号航行在北大西洋的冰冻地带时，瞭望员突然看到一座冰山。

    

    



After the alarm had been given, the great ship turned sharply to avoid a direct collision. The Titanic turned just in time, narrowly missing the immense wall of ice which rose over 100 feet out of the water beside her.

在响过警报之后，巨轮马上急转弯，避开与冰山直接撞击。泰坦尼克及时转弯，擦着高出海面100英尺的巨大冰山过去。

PS：narrowly missing，擦肩而过。

    

    



Suddenly, there was a slight trembling sound from below, and the captain went down to see what had happened.

突然，从船下面传来一阵震动的声音，船长马上下到船舱来看到底发生了什么。

    

    



The noise had been so faint that no one thought that the ship had been damaged. Below, the captain realized to his horror that the Titanic was sinking rapidly, for five of her sixteen watertight compartments had already been flooded!

这股声音太轻，以致于没人相信船要沉了。但是，在下面船舱的船长恐惧地意识到，泰坦尼克很快就要沉，因为它的五个密封水舱已经进水了！

PS：to one's horror, 惊恐地

    

    





The order to abandon ship was given and hundreds of people plunged into the icy water. As there were not enough lifeboats for everyone, 1500 lives were lost!

他发出了弃船的命令，于是成百上千的人栽入了冰冷的水中。因为没有足够的救生艇，1500余人因此丧生。

PS：plunge into, 栽进，一头扎进。
