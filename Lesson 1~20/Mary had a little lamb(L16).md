Mary and her husband Dimitri lived in the tiny village of Perachora in southern Greece. One of the Mary's prize possessions was a little white lamb which her husband gave her.

玛丽和他的丈夫迪米特里住在希腊南部一个叫波拉考拉的小村庄里。玛丽最有价值的财产之一就是丈夫送给她的一只小白羔羊。

    

    



She kept it tied to a tree in a field during the day and went to fetch it every evening. One evening, however, the lamb was missing. The rope had been cut, so it was obvious that the lamb had been stolen.

玛丽白天把羔羊绑在田野上，晚上就牵走它。然而有一天，羔羊就丢了。绳子被剪断了，很明显，羊被人偷了。

PS：it is obvious that ..., 译为“很明显，...”

    

    



When Dimitri came in from the fields, his wife told him what had happened. Dimitri at once set out to find the thief. He knew it would not prove difficult in such a small village.

当迪米特里从田野回到家，玛丽和他说明了情况。迪米特里立刻出发去找小偷。他知道在这个小村抓到小偷并不难。

PS: it would not prove difficult, 译为 “...并不难”

    

    



After telling several of his friends about the theft, Dimitri found out that his neighbor, Aleko, had suddenly acquired a new lamb. Dimitri immediately went to Aleko's house and angrily accused him of stealing the lamb.

在他把盗窃事件告诉他几个朋友以后，迪米特里发现他的邻居阿列科家多了一只小羔羊。他立刻去了阿列科家，生气地控诉他的偷羊行为。

He told him he had better return it or he would call the police. Aleko denied taking it and led Dimitri into his backyard. It was true that he had just bought a lamb, he explained, but his lamb was black.

迪米特里要他立刻交出羔羊，否则会报警。阿列科否认偷羊并将迪米特里带到后院。他说他的确买了一只羊，不过是黑的。

PS：had better do, 最好做什么，语气很强烈，且常带有威胁口吻

PS++：deny doing，否认做...

    

    



Ashamed of having acted so rashly, Dimitri apologized to Aleko for having accused him. While they were talking it began to rain and Dimitri stayed in Aleko's house until the rain stopped.

迪米特里为自己的鲁莽感到羞愧，并向阿列科道歉，说错怪了他。但当他们交谈时，正好开始下雨了，于是迪米特里就在阿列科家避雨，直到雨过天晴。

When he went outside half an hour later, he was astonished to find that the little black lamb was almost white. Its woo, which had been dyed black, had been washed clean bu the rain!

半小时后，当他走出屋子，惊奇地发现这只羔羊浑身透白。原来都被染黑的羊毛都被雨水冲刷掉了！
