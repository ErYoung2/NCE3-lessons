Has it ever happened to you? Have you ever put your trousers in the washing machine and then remembered there was a large bank note in your back pocket?

这种事情在你身上发生过吗？你曾经把裤子放进洗衣机，然后忘记了裤子的后兜有一张大面值的纸币？

PS：a large bank note, 大面值的纸币， note做钞票理解

    

    



When you rescued your trousers, did you find the note was whiter than white? People who live in Britain needn't despair when they make mistakes like this(and a lot of people do!).

当你拯救了你的裤子以后，你有没有发现那张钞票比白纸还白？当英国人犯这种错误时（而且很多人犯这种错误！），大可不必绝望。

PS：whiter than white, 比白纸还白，很经典的用法。

    

    



Fortunately for them, the Bank of England has a team called Mutilated Ladies which deals with claims from people who fed their money to a machine or do their dog. Dogs, it seems, love to chew up money.

幸运的是，英国的银行有一个残钞鉴定组，他们负责处理把那些钱塞给机器或塞给狗的人提出的索赔要求。看起来，狗很喜欢咀嚼钱币。

    

    



A recent case concerns Jane Butlin whose fiance, John, runs a successful furniture business. John had a very good day and put his wallet containing 3000 pounds into the microwave oven for safekeeping.

最近，有一个与简·巴特林的案件，他的未婚夫约翰，有一片成功的家具生意。某天约翰的生意很好，然后他把含有3000英镑的钱包放进微波炉进行保管。

    

    



Then he and Jane went horse-riding. When they got home, Jane cooked their dinner in the microwave oven and without realizing it, cooked her finance's wallet as well.

然后他和简就去骑马了。当他们回到家时，简用微波炉煮饭，但她并没有意识到她男朋友的钱包在里边。

    

    



Imagine their dismay when they found a beautifully-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash! John went to see his bank manager who sent the remains of wallet and the money to the special department of the Bank of England in Newcastle: The Mutilated Ladies!

想象一下他们发现一只煮得很好看的钱包，钞票都成灰的沮丧心情！于是约翰去找银行经理，经理把约翰的钱包和残留物交给了英国银行在纽卡斯尔的一个专门部门--残钞鉴别组。

PS：beautiful-cooked wallet and notes turned to ash, wallet和notes的定语一前一后，很有意思。

    

    



They examined the remains and John got all his money back! 'So long as there's something to identify, we will give people their money back,' said the spokesman for the Bank. 'Last year, we paid 1.5 million pounds on 21000 claims.'

他们检查了残留物，并赔付了约翰所有的钱！“只要我们可以辨识这些残留物，我们就会进行理赔”。银行的发言人说。“我们已累计对21000起索赔要求赔付了150万英镑”。

PS：So long as，只要的意思，同as long as, 但是有否定意味。而as long as则可用于肯定/否定句中，但多用于肯定句。

PS++: Mutilated Ladies，英国银行专门负责识别和鉴定残钞的组织。其中, lady指英女王。
