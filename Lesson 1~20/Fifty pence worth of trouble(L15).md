Children always appreciate small gifts of money. Mom or dad, of course, provide a regular supply of pocket money, but uncles and aunts are always a source of extra income.

孩子们总是喜欢得到一些零花钱。当然，父母会时常给孩子零花钱，但是叔舅婶姨也是孩子们零花钱额外的来源。

PS：regular supply, 常规支持；a source of extra income，外快来源。

    

    



With some children, small sums go a long way. If fifth pence pieces are not exchanged for sweets, they rattle for months inside money boxes.

对于一些孩子来说，一笔小钱可以花很久。如果五十便士不去换糖，他们会把钱放进存钱罐，叮当响上好几个月。

PS：go a long way, 撑很久

    

    



Only very thrifty children manage to fill up the money box. For most of them, fifty pence is a small price to pay for a nice big bar of chocolate.

只有非常节俭的孩子才会把存钱罐存满。对于大部分孩子来说，用五十便士买一块又大又好的巧克力，是小事一桩。

PS: a small price，小事一桩。

    

    



My nephew, George, has a money box but it is always empty. Very few of the fifty pence pieces and pound coins I have given him have found their way there.

我的侄子乔治有一个存钱罐，但是总是空的。我给了他不少50便士的钱币，但没有几个放在存钱罐里。

PS：这句话我不是很明白，感觉像是强调句，否定意义副词在前，却未倒装。应该是have I given him才对吧。。。。。

    

    



I gave him fifty pence yesterday and advised him to save it. Instead he bought himself fifty pence worth of trouble.

我昨天给了他50便士，建议他存起来。但是他还是给自己买了50便士的麻烦。

PS：fifty pence worth of trouble， 价值50便士的麻烦。

    

    



On his way to the sweet shop, he dropped his fifty pence and it bounced along the pavement and then disappeared down a drain. George took off his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and pushed him right arm through the drain cover.

在他去糖果店的路上，他把五十便士的钱币掉了，钱币在人行道上蹦了几下，掉进了水沟里。于是乔治脱掉了夹克，撸起了袖子，把右胳膊伸进了水沟里。

    

    



He couldn't find his fifty pence piece anywhere, and what is more, he could not get his arm out. A crowd of people gathered round him and a lady rubbed his arm with soap and butter, but George was firmly stuck.

他到处都找不到那五十便士，更严重的是，他的胳膊出不来了。于是一群人聚集在他身边，一位女士用肥皂和黄油擦他的胳膊，但是乔治仍然被死死卡住。

PS：what is more, 更严重的是，递进关系。

PS++：be firmly stuck,被死死卡住/困住，脱不开身。

    

    



The fire brigade was called and two fire fighters freed George using a special type of grease. George was not too upset by his experience because the lady who owns the sweet shop heard about his troubles and rewarded him with a large box of chocolates.

有人打电话叫了消防队，两名消防队员用一种特殊的润滑油把乔治解放出来。但乔治并不因这种倒霉事生气，因为这位女士是糖果店的老板，听说他遭遇的麻烦后，奖励了他一大块巧克力。

PS：这个"the lady"是否为前面的帮小男孩擦黄油的"the lady"呢？

总体感觉这篇文章选得一般，我认为存在两处歧义点。
