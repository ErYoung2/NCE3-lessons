Modern sculpture rarely surprises us any more. The idea that modern art can only be seen in museums is mistaken. Even people who take no interest in art cannot have failed to notice examples of modern sculpture on display in public places.

现代雕塑早已无法惊艳我们，现代艺术仅存于博物馆的说法也系误读。即使对艺术最无感的人也不会注意不到公开场合展览的现代雕塑。

PS：... is mistaken，。。。系误读。

PS++：take no interest in，对...没兴趣。

PS++++：can't have failed to notice，不至于没注意到，双重否定。

    

    



Strange forms stand in gardens, and outside building and shops. We have got quite used of them. Some so-called 'modern' pieces have been on display for nearly eighty years.

公园里、大楼和商店外竖立着奇形怪状的雕塑。我们已习惯它们的存在。一些所谓的“现代”作品都已陈列近80年了。

PS：be/get used of  sth/doing sth，习惯...。

PS++：so called，号称，所谓。

    

    



In spite of this, some people--including myself--were surprised by a recent exhibition of modern sculpture. The first thing I saw when I entered the art gallery was a notice which said:"Do not touch the exhibits. Some of them are dangerous!"

尽管如此，很多人（包括我）都惊叹与最近的一个现在雕塑展。当我进入展馆的时候，我首先看到一块告示：“不要触摸这些展品，有些展品很危险！”

    

    



The objects on display were pieces of moving sculpture. Oddly shaped forms that are suspended from the ceiling and moving in response to a gust of wind are quite familiar to everybody.

展品都是活动的雕塑。人们都很熟悉这些造型古怪，挂在天花板上，随风飘荡的雕塑。

PS：move in response to a gust of wind，随风飘荡。in response to，作出反应。

PS++：be quite familiar to sth，对...十分熟悉。

    

    



These objects, however, were different. Lined up against the wall, there were long thin wires attached to metal spheres. The spheres had been magnetized and attracted or repelled each other all the time.

然而，这些展品却令人大开眼界。靠墙排列着许多细长的电线，而电线又连接着金属球。金属球收到磁化，不停地相互吸引排斥。

PS：attach to sth，连接着...。

PS++：attract or repell each other，相互吸引排斥。

    

    



In the center of the hall, there were a number of tall structures which contained coloured lights. These lights flickered continuously like traffic lights which have gone mad. Sparks were emitted from small black boxes and red lamps flashed on and off angrily.

大厅中央，有许多装满彩灯的构件。灯泡一刻不停地闪烁，好像失去控制的红绿灯。小黑盒里迸出火花，红色灯泡发怒似的忽明忽暗。

PS：go mad，失去控制，疯狂。

PS++：flash on and off, 忽明忽暗。

    

    



It was rather like an exhibition of prehistoric electronic. These peculiar forms not only seemed designed to shock people emotionally, but to give them electric shocks as well!

这更像是史前的电子设备。好像设计这些奇形怪状的展品不仅是为了给人强烈的感官刺激，还给他们遭电击的感觉！

PS：give them electric shocks，用电击他们。
