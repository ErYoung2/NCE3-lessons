Some time ago, an interesting discovery was made by archaeologists on the Aegean island of Kea. An American team explored a temple which stands in an ancient city on the promonotory of Ayia Irini.

不久之前，在爱琴海的亚基岛上，考古学家们有一个很有趣的发现。一支美国的科考队在阿伊亚·依里尼海的一座古城里发现了一座庙宇。

    

    



The city at one time must have been prosperous, for it enjoyed a high level of civilization Houses--often three stories high--were built of stone.

这座古城肯定一度非常繁荣，因为它曾享有高度的文明，房屋一般有3层楼高，且用石头建造。

PS：at one time, 一度

PS++: must have been，过去一定很...

    

    



They had large rooms with beautifully decorated walls. The city was even equipped with a drainage system, for a great many clay pipes were found beneath the narrow streets.

房间很大，墙壁装饰华丽。城里一度铺设了排水系统，因为在狭窄的街道底下发现了许许多多陶土制作的排水管道。

    

    



The temple which the archaeologists explored was used as a place of worship from fifteenth century B.C. until Roman times. In the most sacred room of the temple, clay fragments of fifteen status were found.

考古学家考察的这座庙宇从公元前15世纪直至罗马时代一直是祭祀的场所，在庙宇中最神圣的一间殿堂，发现了15尊陶制雕像的碎片。

    

    



Each of these represented a goddess and had, at one time, been printed. The body of one status was found among remains dating from the fifteenth century B.C. Its missing head happened to be among remains of the fifth century B.C.

每一尊陶像代表一位女神，而且一度上过色。其中有一尊雕像，她的躯体是在公元前15世纪的历史文物中发现的，而她那身首异处的脑袋却是在公元前五世纪的文物中找到的。

PS: date from，追溯到。。。

    

    



This head must have been found in Classical times and carefully preserved. It was very old and precious even then. When the archaeologists reconstructed the fragments, they were amazed to find that the goddess return out to be a very modern-looking woman.

她的脑袋一定是在古希腊古罗马时代就为人所发现，并收到了精心的保护。即使在当时，它也是历史悠久的珍奇之物。考古工作者把这些碎片重新拼装起来后，他们惊奇地发现这尊女神原来是一位相貌及其摩登的女郎。

PS：Classical times, 在西方就指古希腊和古罗马。

PS++：turn out to be ...，被证明是。。。

    

    



She stood three feet high and her hands rested on her lip. She was wearing a full-length skirt which swept the ground. Despite her great age, she was very graceful indeed, but, so far, the archaeologists have been unable to discover her identity.

她身高3英尺，双手叉腰，身穿一条拖地长裙。尽管上了年纪，但体态的确优美。但是，到现在为止，考古学家们还是没能发现她的身份。
