These days, people who do manual work often receive far more money than people who work in offices.

如今，做手工活儿的人们通常比坐办公室的人们拿到更多的薪水。





People who work in offices are frequently referred to as 'white-collar workers' for the simple reason that they usually wear a collar and tie to go to work.

坐办公室的人们通常被人称为“白领工人”，只是因为他们上班时都会穿白衬衫，系领带。

PS: refer to，被称为...，参考...





Such is human nature, that a great many people are willing to sacrifice higher pay for the privilege of becoming white-collar workers. This can give rise to curious situations, as it did in the case of Alfred Bloggs who worked as a dustman for the Ellesmere Corporation.

许多人宁愿牺牲高薪水，而选择白领的殊荣，这也是人之常情。而这常常会引来奇怪的现象，例如在艾里斯梅尔公司上班的阿尔弗雷德·布洛克斯就是这样。

PS: Such is human nature, ...是人之常情，后加同位语从句。

PS++: the privilege of...， ...的殊荣。

PS++++: This can give rise to curious situations, ...会引来奇怪的现象





When he got married, Alf was too embarrassed to say anything to his wife about his job. He simply told her that he worked for the Corporation.

当他结婚的时候，艾尔弗感到很尴尬，他没有告诉妻子他的工作，只是简单地说他在艾里斯梅尔公司上班。

PS：too ... to， 太...以至于不能...





Every morning, he left home dressed in a smart black suit. He then changed into overalls and spent the next eight hours as a dustman.

他每天早晨离开家时，都会穿一件很时髦的黑色西装。 然后换上工作服，当8个小时的清洁工。





Before returning home at home, he took a shower and changed back into his suit. Alf did this for over two years and his fellow dustmen kept his secret.

在他回到家之前，他会洗个澡，然后换上那件西装回家。连续两年，艾尔弗都这么做，他的同事也在帮他保守这个秘密。

PS：fellow, 簇拥，伙伴，此处译为“同事”。





Alf's wife has never discovered that she married a dustman and she never will, for Alf has just found another job. He will soon be working in an office.

但是艾尔弗的妻子从未发现，而且也不可能再发现他与一个清洁工结了婚，因为艾尔弗找到了另一份坐办公室的工作。





He will be earning only half as much as he used to, but he feels that his rise in status is well worth the loss of money. From now on, he will wear a suit all day and others will call him 'Mr.Bloggs' , not 'Alf'.

虽然他将仅仅赚取原来一半的薪水，但是他觉得跟他的地位上升这件事比起来，金钱的损失是值得的。从此，他可以整天穿西服上班，而且别人会叫他“布洛克斯先生”，而不是“艾尔弗”了。

PS：A is well worth （than）B, A比B值得。此处我觉得应该要加than的。
