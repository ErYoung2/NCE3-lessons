Our vicar is always raising money for one cause or another, but he has never managed to get enough money to have the church clock repaired.

我们教区的牧师总是为各种各样的事情筹集资金，但是他从未筹足资金将教堂的钟表修好。

PS++: have ... repaired/fixed， 使···被修好

The big clock which used to strike the hours day and night was damaged many years ago and has been silent ever since.

这只大钟曾经不分昼夜地打点报时，但是它在很多年前被毁坏了，从那时起，它就无声无息了。

&nbsp;

One night, however, our vicar woke up with a start: the clock was striking the hours! Looking at his watch, he saw that it was one'o clock, but the bell struck thirteen times before it stopped.

一天，我们的牧师突然被惊醒了：这口钟居然在打点报时！他看了一下自己的手表，是凌晨1点，但是大钟却敲了13下才停！

PS: wake up with a start是“受到惊动，被惊醒”的意思。with a start 有 “收到惊动”的意思。

&nbsp;

Armed with a torch, the vicar went up into the clock tower to see what was going on. In the torchlight, he caught sight of a figure whom he immediately recognized as Bill Wilkins, our local grocer.

于是牧师带了一只手电筒，进入了钟塔，去检查倒低发生了什么。在手电筒的灯光映衬下，他看见一个人。他立马认出了对方是本地的杂货店主，比尔·威尔金斯。

&nbsp;

‘Whatever are you doing up here Bill?’ asked the vicar in surprise.

'你究竟在这里做什么，比尔？'牧师惊讶地问道。

PS：Whatever 与 What同意，语气加强。

&nbsp;

‘I'm trying to repair the bell.’ answered Bill. 'I've been coming up here night after night for weeks now. You see, I was hoping to give you a surprise.'

'我正在试图把钟修好。'比尔答道，‘我已经连续几周在夜里来这里修钟了。你看，我希望给你个惊喜！’

&nbsp;

‘You certainly did give me a surprise!’ said the vicar.'You've probably woken up everyone in the village as well. Still, I'm glad the bell is working again.'

'当然，你的的确确给了我个惊喜！' 牧师说。 ‘你也把村子里每个人都吵醒了。即使如此，这钟可以重新工作，我也很高兴的。’

PS: do表强调，在此翻译为“的的确确”。

&nbsp;

‘That's the trouble, vicar.’ answered Bill. 'It's working all right, but I'm afraid that at one'o clock it will strike thirteen times and there's nothing I can do about it.'

'问题就在这里，牧师'。比尔答道。‘它现在是工作了，但是我怕的是，它会在一点的时候敲13下，而我却无能为力’。

&nbsp;

‘We'll get used to that, Bill.’ said the vicar. 'Thirteen is not as good as one, but it's better than nothing. Now let's go downstairs and have a cup of tea.'

'我们会习惯它的，比尔。'牧师说。‘虽然响13下不如响1下那么好，但是总比不响好。来，我们下楼去喝杯茶吧。’

PS: be/get used to + sth/doing sth， 习惯某事/做某事。
