The expensive shops in a famous near Piccadilly were just opening. At that time of the morning, the arcade was almost empty.
几家昂贵的商店矗立在皮卡迪利大街的拱道两旁，即将开业。这天早晨，拱道几乎空无一人。

    



Mr.Tarlor, the owner of a jewelry shop was admiring a new window display. Two of his assistance had been working busily since eight'o clock and had only just finished.
珠宝店的老板，泰勒先生，正在欣赏新布置的橱窗展览。他的两个助手从八点开始忙，总算忙完了。

Diamond necklaces and rings had been beautifully arranged on a background of black velvet. After gazing at the display for several minutes, Mr. Taylor went back into his shop.
钻石项链和戒指已经被漂亮地陈列在黑色丝绒上面。泰勒先生在凝视了几分钟之后，回到了店里。

The silence was suddenly broken when a large car, with its headlights on and its horn blaring, roared down the arcade.
当一辆开着头灯、响着喇叭的大车呼啸着冲过拱道时，宁静被突然打破。
PS: with引导的伴随状语，修饰car

    



It came to a stop outside the jeweler's. One man stayed at the wheel while two other with black stockings over their faces jumped out and smashed the window of the shop with iron bars.
他们在珠宝店外停车。一人留在驾驶座上，还有两人带着黑色丝袜蒙着面，跳下车冲了进来，用铁棒打碎了橱窗玻璃。

    



While this was going on, Mr. Taylor was upstairs. He and his staff  began throwing furniture out of the window. Chairs and the tables went flying into the arcade.
当抢案发生的时候，泰勒先生在楼上。他和助手开始将家具丢出窗户。桌子、椅子都飞向了拱道。

    



One of the thieves was struck by a heavy statue, but he was too busy helping himself to diamonds to notice any pain. The raid was all over in three minutes, for the man scrambled back into the car and it moved off at a fantastic speed.
其中一名匪徒被一尊很重的雕像砸中，但是他太沉迷抢劫宝石，根本不管有多痛。这起抢劫只持续了三分钟，因为抢匪都悻悻地跑回了车上，并以惊人的速度逃离了。
PS：help oneself to/doing...，沉迷某物/做某事，不可自拔。这里意思为“擅自占用、侵占某物”的意思。

    



Just as it was leaving, Mr. Tarlor rushed out and ran after it throwing ashtrays and vases, but it was impossible to stop the thieves. They had got away with thousands of pounds worth of diamonds.
当匪徒离开的时候，泰勒先生冲出去追他们，并用烟灰缸和花瓶丢他们。但是这并不能阻止这伙抢匪。他们已经带着价值成千上万英镑的钻石跑路了。
