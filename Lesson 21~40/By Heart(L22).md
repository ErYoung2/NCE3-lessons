One night, the gaoler decided to play a joke on his colleague to find out if, after so many performances, he had managed to learn the contents of the letter by heart. The curtain went up on the final act of the play and revealed the aristocrat sitting alone behind bars in his dark cell.

The gaoler looked on eagerly, anxious to see if his fellow actor had at last learnt his lines. The noble stared at the blank sheet of paper for a few seconds. Then, squinting his eyes, he said: 'The light is dim. Read the letter to me.'

监狱长热切地看着，急于想看到贵族是否熟记了台词。贵族看了几秒空白的信纸，然后眯上眼，说到：“灯光太暗了，你给我读读吧”。

And he promptly handed the sheet of paper to the gaoler. Finding that he could not remember a word of the letter either, the gaoler replied:"The light is indeed dim, sire. I must get my glasses."

然后他一下子把信递给监狱长。但监狱长也一个字也不记得，就答道：“灯光的确很暗，先生。我得找找眼睛先”。

With this, he hurried off the stage. Much to the aristocrat's amusement, the gaoler returned a few moments later with a pair of glasses and the usual copy of the letter which he proceeded to read to the the prisoner.

于是，他立刻跑下台去。令贵族感到非常好笑的是，监狱长一会功夫就回来了，拿着他的眼镜和那封写满的信，然后为囚犯念了起来。
