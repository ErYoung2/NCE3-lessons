People become quite illogical when they try to decide what can be eaten and cannot be eaten. If you lived in the Mediterranean, for instance, you would consider octopus a great delicacy. You would not be able to understand why some people find it repulsive.
人们在面对“吃什么不吃什么”的时候总是不理智。例如，如果你住在地中海地区，你会认为章鱼是珍馐，而且你也不会理解为什么有人一见章鱼就恶心。


On the other hand, your stomach would turn at the idea of trying potatoes in animal fat--the normally accepted practice in many northern countries. The sad truth is that most of us have been brought up to eat certain foods and we stick to them all our lives.
另一方面，你一想到用动物油炸土豆就十分反胃，但在许多北方国家却是一种频繁的烹饪方法。事实上，我们大多数生长过程中都吃特定的食物，以致于我们会终生坚持这样吃。
PS: stomach would turn at the idea of，此处“turn”当反胃讲；at the idea of，一想到...。合起来就是：一想到...就反胃。
       此处turn的用法第一次见，我查字典发现有这个用法： stomach turns，胃不舒服、反胃。


No creature has received more praise and abuse than the common garden snail. Cooked in wine, snails are a great luxury in various parts of the world. These are countless people who, ever since their early years, have learnt to associate snails with food.
没有一种生物受到的赞誉和非议多过花园里常见的蜗牛了。蜗牛用酒烹饪后，就成了世界上大部分地区的珍馐。数不清的人们从很小时候就将蜗牛同食物联系起来。
PS：No creature has received more praise and abuse than，没有什么比...受到的赞誉和非议更多了。常用句式，非常好用！
PS++：cooked in wine，用酒烹饪后，做定语。
PS++++: These are countless people who, ever since their early years, have learnt to associate snails with food. 主句为:These are countless people who have learnt to associate with food。这里“who, ever since their early years”做时间状语，修饰countless people，译为“数不清的人们从小开始就把蜗牛和食物联系起来”。


My friend, Robert, lives in a country where snails are despised. As his flat is in a large town, he has no garden of his own. For years he has been asking me to collect snails from my garden and take them to him.
我的朋友罗伯特，住在一个厌恶蜗牛的国家。他生活在大城市的公寓里，没有自己的花园。多年以来他一直要求我从我的花园收集蜗牛带给他。


The idea never appealed to me very much, but one day, after a heavy shower, I happened to be walking in my garden when I noticed a huge number of snails taking a stroll on some of my prize plants.
我开始不是很在意，但某天，一场大雨后，我碰巧在花园里散步，突然发现一大群蜗牛在我某些心爱的植物上面慢慢地蠕动。
PS：happened to be walking in my garden，碰巧在花园里散步。happen to，恰巧。
PS++：prize plants，心爱的植物（不是昂贵的植物）。


Acting on a sudden impulse, I collected several dozen, put them in a paper bag, and took them to Robert. Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift. I left the bag in the hall and Robert and I went into the living room where we talked for a couple of hours.
我下意识地收集了抓了几打蜗牛，把它们放进纸包里，带给了罗伯特。罗伯特看到我很高兴，对我的小礼物也非常满意。我把包包放在客厅，然后和他去卧室聊了几个钟的天。
PS：Acting on a sudden impulse，下意识地。
PS++：Robert was delighted to see me and equally pleased with my little gift.  这里“equally”表示也，强调and的意思，前后感情色彩相同。


I had forgotten all about the snails when Robert suddenly said that I must stay to dinner. Snails would, of course, be the main dish. I didn't fancy the idea and I reluctantly followed Robert out of the room.
我都忘了蜗牛的事儿了，直到罗伯特突然说留我吃晚饭。不用说，蜗牛就是主餐。我不是很同意这主意，不情愿地跟着他出了卧室。
PS：reluctantly，勉强地，不情愿地。

    
To our dismay, we saw that there were snails everywhere: they had escaped from the paper bag and had taken complete possession of the hall! I have never been able to look at a snail since then.
令我们大吃一惊的是，客厅到处都是蜗牛。他们从纸袋跑出来，完全占据了客厅！从那以后，我再也不能看一眼蜗牛了~:(
PS：To our dismay，令我们大吃一惊的是。
PS++: take complete possession of，完全占据。
